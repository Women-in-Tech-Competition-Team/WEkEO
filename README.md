## **Overview**  
The **SustainLink Dashboard** is a web platform designed to connect companies with local nonprofits to address air and water quality challenges in regions affected by industrial activities. By combining real-time environmental data with company operations and nonprofit initiatives, the platform enables targeted climate action that benefits both businesses and communities.

## **Problem Statement**  
Climate change and environmental degradation often disproportionately affect the areas surrounding industrial operations, leading to deteriorating air and water quality.  
- Struggle to identify meaningful ways to offset their environmental footprint locally.  
- Lack sufficient funding and visibility to scale their climate action initiatives.  
- Suffer from environmental impacts without adequate resources to address the damage.  

The **Community Climate Action Dashboard** bridges these gaps by fostering collaboration and providing actionable insights.
